Annex A — Selection Criteria (Eligibility, Primary & Secondary)
A1. Eligibility (Pass/Fail)[RK1] 

E1. Registration & Legality (Pass/Fail)

Must be a legally recognized cluster entity (MSME association, cooperative, company) with a valid registration number.
Evidence: Certificate of registration + registration number as per application.
Fail if: Unregistered, unverifiable registration, or under legal sanction.
E2. County Mapping (Pass/Fail)

·       Applicants must indicate one home county only, with verified ward/constituency details.

·       This step ensures accurate geographic tagging of each application for subsequent allocation.

·       All applications that meet the basic eligibility requirements proceed to scoring. The county allocation rule of “two per county” is applied only after scoring and ranking are completed, during the shortlisting stage.

E3. Priority Value Chain (Pass/Fail)

·       Must operate in one of the designated priority value chains under KJET: Edible Oils, Dairy (excluding farming), Textiles, or Construction.

·       In addition, applications operating in the additional value chains identified under BETA , Rice, Tea, Blue Economy, Minerals, Forestry, or Leather, will also be considered within this selection process.

·       Applications outside these priority and additional value chains will be parked for future calls.

E4. Minimum Financial Evidence (Pass/Fail)

At least one: MPESA statement, bank statement, income statement, or balance sheet from the last 12 months.
Fail if: No verifiable financial evidence.
E5. Consent & Contactability (Pass/Fail)

Valid contact person & phone; consent to data verification.
Decision Box – Eligibility

If any E1–E5 fails → mark INELIGIBLE; exclude from scoring.
If all pass → proceed to Primary Criteria scoring.

7.2.  A2. Primary Criteria (Weighted)
These mirror the ToR’s core assessments. Each criterion is scored 0–5 using the rubric in A3 and then converted to a weighted contribution.

Registration & Track Record (Weight: 5%)
Legal status, governance, and years operational.
Financial Position (Weight: 20%)
Turnover trend, liquidity proxies from statements, basic stability.
Market Demand & Competitiveness (Weight: 20%)
Evidence of demand (buyers, orders), channels (wholesale/retail/digital), price/quality positioning.
Business Proposal / Growth Viability (Weight: 25%)
Problem–solution clarity, feasibility, SMART targets, budget realism, risk/mitigation.[RK2] [EN3] 
Value Chain Alignment & Role (Weight: 10%)
Clear role within one of the 4 priority VCs; contribution to upgrading (e.g., aggregation, processing, standards).
Inclusivity & Sustainability (Weight: 20%)
Participation of women & youth, PWD inclusion; green practices (resource efficiency, waste reduction).
Total = 100%

Why weights? Emphasis on proposal viability and market potential aligns BDS with clusters most likely to execute and scale. VC alignment and inclusivity reflect policy priorities without distorting core viability.

2: Vague plan; limited targets; unclear resourcing.
1: Aspirational; no plan/targets.
0: Not provided.
A3.5 Value Chain Alignment & Role (10%)

5: Priority VC; fills a critical node (e.g., aggregation/processing); documented linkages upstream & downstream.
4: Priority VC; clear node participation; some linkages.
3: Priority VC; weak linkages; potential to upgrade.
2: Peripheral role; unclear node.
1: Marginal link.
0: Not in priority VC.
A3.6 Inclusivity & Sustainability (20%%)

5: ≥50% women or ≥50% youth participation (or ≥30% women leadership); PWD inclusion; 2+ green practices adopted.
4: Strong gender/youth participation; 1–2 green practices.
3: Moderate inclusion; some intent on sustainability.
2: Low inclusion; ad-hoc green steps.
1: Token inclusion; no green practice.
0: No evidence.
Policy Box – No quotas in scoring
Inclusivity improves scores but county allocation ensures geographic equity; no demographic quotas are enforced outside the rubric.

 

A4. Disqualifiers & Penalties

DQ1: Fraudulent documents or misrepresentation → Immediate disqualification.
P1: Major data inconsistencies or unresolved anomalies → –5 points (applied to total).
P2: Non-cooperation in verification → –3 points or DQ if persistent.

Random seeded tie-break (document seed)
 [RK1]To what extent will this already have been done by MSEA? Do we really need the selection provider to do this again?

 [RK2]I see these areas as very much linked and potentially combinable. If they are kept separate, we could perhaps weight competitiveness more. The BDS is meant to help with the business proposal.

 [EN3]Linked and combinable. Agreed

 [RK4]I see this as by far the most important part of this report and generally think that this is reasonable and well thought out. Nevertheless, flagging for MSEA to take another look at the various thresholds to see if they seem reasonable in the Kenyan context.
